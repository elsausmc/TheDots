See them dots? I gave'm brains! Tiny little stupid brains, but brains nonetheless.

This started out as an idea of what would dots do if I gave them some inputs about their surroundings and a neural network to decide what to do. 

This is the true story, of hundres of dots, picked to live in a browser, eat each other, and have their lives watched. Find out what happens, when pixels stop being polite, and start getting real... 

They start out with no brains and the greyest of greys.
Eventually they develop brains and change colors.
Each dot has it's own unique neural network. As inputs they know
And they have four outputs that get used to determine up/down and left/right.
Start with some energy.
Dot with most energy consumes dot with less energy.
